**AI Engineer | Full Stack Developer | Problem Solver**  

## About Me

I am Alokkumar Gupta, a B.Tech undergraduate in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and software development.

I have developed a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms, solving 300+ problems to enhance my problem-solving and analytical skills. Alongside this, I specialize in Full-Stack Development (MERN Stack), building scalable, performance-oriented web applications with secure authentication, optimized APIs, and modern UI/UX practices.

My project experience includes developing a LeetCode-style coding platform with AI integration and a responsive food delivery application, focusing on clean architecture, modular design, and performance optimization.

I am also actively involved in mentoring students in competitive programming and organizing technical events, reflecting my leadership and community engagement.

I am continuously working toward strengthening my expertise in AI-driven systems, system design, and scalable backend architectures to build impactful real-world solutions.
